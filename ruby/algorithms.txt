I am going to assume that the robot starts at the elevator it will use.

locate the floor you are currently on
if the current floor is greater than the target floor
	press the down elevator-call button
if the current floor is less than the target floor
	press the up elevator-call button
If you are in a hurry
	continue pressing the button
	chant “come on”
Otherwise step away from the elevator doors and wait until they open
if anyone is leaving the elevator
	Wait for them to exit
walk into the elevator
start turning clockwise
When you see a panel of buttons, stop turning
	If you turn 360 degrees and don’t see a panel of buttons
		You are in a broom cupboard
		leave the cupboard and find the elevator
		Start over from step one
move your finger to the top-left button

if the button does not have the same number as the target floor move your finger to the right
Otherwise press the button
If your finger is not in front of a button
	move your finger down one row and place it in front of the left most button on that row
repeat this step until a button is pressed

Step away from the elevator door and watch the floor display. (Whatever this elevator has that tells what floor it’s on)
When the floor display indicates the target floor
	Wait for the doors to open
Exit the elevator
Do a little dance
