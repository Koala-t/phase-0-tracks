# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to backup data. It is useful because you can retrieve data if one of the devices it is stored on is broken or lost. It also allows you to roll-back any changes you've made to a previous state if something goes horribly wrong with the code itself.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is essentially a copy of code. It allows you to make changes to the code without effecting the working copy until you are happy with the changes and confident that they wont bug-out or cause unexpected behavior.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save-point where you are happy with the changes you've made to the code. You can go back to how the code was at any commit so it is good to commit often rather than trying to dicipher one huge commit later on. A good commit message is direct, clear and describes the changes made to the code since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when you try to merge two branches with the same file that has differences in it. It will stop the merge and ask you to resolve the differences before it continues.
