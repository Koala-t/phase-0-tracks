# jQuery

## notes:
jQuery is a javascript library that helps you to:
* get and set DOM attributes to an element
* get and set CSS properties of elements
* associate arbitrary data with DOM elements
* apply animations to the elements
* add events in response to user-actions
* handle forms
* Otherwise traverse or manipulate the DOM
