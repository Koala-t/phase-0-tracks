<!--I had a great time pairing with Thomas. He was clearly excited about the material and having fun with it which was contagious. 
HTML5 semantic tags help developers interpret your code and allow some programs to help handicapped people navigate the webpage. Like a program which will read the information out for a blind user. I think the <main> tag is the most useful because it designates the most important information on the page. Article and aside seem quite useful too. 
The browser displays elements on the page in the order they are written: An element on line 5 will come before an element on line 7 (above if they are block-level elements and to the left if they are inline elements).
I already knew how to use some snippets but learning to make snippets of my own was pretty cool. It will definitley come in handy later on.
Surprisingly I had the most difficulty with something which wasn't a part of this assignment. Finding the file to save my new snippet in turned out to be challenging. Besides that some of the semantic elements seemed to be very similar to others and it was tricky trying to understand where they were different and when I would use one rather than another. -->
